# VaporWave

[VaporWave](http://vaporwave-app.herokuapp.com/) is a [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/) clone. It is an online music sharing platform where anyone, from up-and-coming artists to professionals, can upload their music for users to discover. Users will be able to listen to any music that is uploaded. The VaporWave name is a play on words of the SoundCloud name and the website's aesthetic.
